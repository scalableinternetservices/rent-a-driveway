This folder is meant to be kept on branch loadtest only, not on any other branch.

To use this branch:
    1. Merge latest master branch to loadtest branch then push

    2. Open cloud formation and create new stack with MySinglePassenger.json as the template.
        That file is modifed to checkout the code from loadtest branch not master
        The URL for the file is this:
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalableinternetservices/rent-a-driveway/loadtest/loadtest/MySinglePassenger.json

    3. Open cloud formation and create new Tsung stack like normal
        Checkout the rent-a-driveway git repo into that new EC2 instance and switch to branch loadtest
        
    4. Fix the server path on the loadtest/*.xml files

    5. Start load test with
        tsung -f <something>.xml start
